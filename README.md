## Course Description
Computational social scientists increasingly need to grapple with data that is too big and code that is too resource intensive to run on a local machine. Using Python, students in this course will learn how to effectively scale their computational methods beyond their local machines -- optimizing and parallelizing their code across clusters of CPUs and GPUs, both on-premises and in the cloud. The focus of the course will be on social scientific applications, such as: accelerating social simulations by several orders of magnitude, processing large amounts of social media data in real-time, and training machine learning models on economic datasets that are too large for an average laptop to handle.

*Prerequisites: MACS 30111 and MACS 30112, or equivalent.*

## Course Structure
Each week in this course is focused on building a fundamental competency in scalable computing, with an emphasis on Computational Social Science research applications.
All readings, assignments, and resources for each of the class sessions can be accessed on the [Canvas course site](canvas_url). If you have any questions about the course content, you should post these questions in the Ed Discussion forum for the course, which can be accessed by clicking the "Ed Discussion" tab on the left side of the screen on the Canvas course site. For an overall schedule and syllabus for the course, as well as to access additional course-related files (which we will walk through in in-class activities), consult (and clone/fork) this GitHub Course Repository.

During regular class hours, we will meet for a mixture of lecture, group activities, and in-class coding exercises related to the topic for the day. Attendance and active participation in each of the class sessions is mandatory and is an important component of the final course grade. Students should prepare for each class by reading the assigned readings for the day ahead of class time. All readings are available online and are linked in the course schedule below (and in the corresponding weekly module on Canvas).

In order to practice scalable computing skills and complete the course assignments, we will provide free access to on-premise cluster computing resources, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud computing resources, and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). More information about accessing these resources will be provided to registered students in the first several weeks of the quarter.

## Grading

Each week, we will release an assignment that is designed to give you a chance to further hone the skills you have learned in class. While there will be a total of 9 assignments, we will drop your lowest 2 assignment scores when calculating your final grade. Overall, these assigments are worth 70% of the overall grade. During our scheduled exam period in Finals Week, there will also be a cumulative final exam, which will count for 20% of the overall grade. Finally, attendance and participation will be worth 10% of the overall grade.

| Course Component                      | Grade Percentage  |
| :-------------                        | :-------------    |
| Assignments (Total: Best 7 of 9)      | 70%               |
| Final Exam                            | 20%               |
| Attendance/Participation              | 10%               |

Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:
* 95-100: A
* 90-95: A-
* 85-90: B+
* 80-85: B
* 75-80: B-
* 70-75: C+
* <70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis

We curve only to the extent we might lower the boundaries for one or more letter grades, depending on the distribution of the raw scores. We will not raise the boundaries in response to the distribution.

So, for example, if you have a total score of 82 in the course, you are guaranteed to get, at least, a B (but may potentially get a higher grade if the boundary for a B+ is lowered).

If you would like to be graded on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis, send a private message to the course staff on the Ed Discussion forum **before the Final Exam is administered**. A total score of 75 and above in the class will qualify for a "P" in the class.

## Participation Expectations
We expect all students to participate in each class session in person (having read all of the readings listed for the day ahead of class time). Your participation grade (10% of your overall grade in the class) will be based on your engagement and completion of in-class activities.

If, for whatever reason, you cannot attend a class session, send a private message to the course staff **ahead of the class session** on the class Ed Discussion forum. We will evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis and assign an alternative assignment to make up participation credit for the day.

## Late Assignments
Unexcused Late Assignment Submissions will be penalized 10 percentage points for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Wednesday at 11:59pm, the following percentage points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit in your private GitHub assignment repository.

| Example last commit |	Percentage points deducted         |
| ----                | ----                               |
| 12:00am to 12:59am  |	-10 percentage points              |
| 1:00am to 1:59am    | -20 percentage points              |
| 2:00am to 2:59am    | -30 percentage points              |
| 3:00am to 3:59am    | -40 percentage points              |
| ...                 |	...                                |
| 9:00am and beyond   |	-100 percentage points (no credit) |

If, for whatever reason, you need an extension on an assignment deadline, send a private message to the course staff **ahead of the assignment deadline** on the class Ed Discussion forum and we will evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis.

## Plagiarism on Assignments
Academic honesty is an extremely important principle in academia and at the University of Chicago.
* Writing assignments must quote and cite any excerpts taken from another work.
* If the cited work is the particular paper referenced in the assignment, no works cited or references are necessary at the end of the composition.
* If the cited work is not the particular paper referenced in the assignment, you MUST include a works cited or references section at the end of the composition.
* Any copying of work other than your own will result in a zero grade and potential further academic discipline.
* If we discover that you have shared or posted questions/solutions from any class assignments or exams in a public, online space, this will also result in a zero grade and potential further academic discipline.

If you have any questions about citations, references, or what constitutes plagiarism, consult with your instructor.

## Statement of Diversity and Inclusion
The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions.

Any suggestions for how we might further such objectives both in and outside the classroom are appreciated and will be given serious consideration. Please share your suggestions or concerns with your instructor, your preceptor, or your program’s Diversity and Inclusion representatives: Darcy Heuring (MAPSS), Matthias Staisch (CIR), and Chad Cyrenne (Computation). You are also welcome and encouraged to contact the Faculty Director(s) of your program.

This course is open to all students who meet the academic requirements for participation. Any student who has a documented need for accommodation should contact Student Disability Services (773-702-6000 or disabilities@uchicago.edu) and the instructor as soon as possible.
